      <h2>Five Real-Life Tips and Stress Management Techniques</h2>

      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Plan Your Week in Advance (Avoid Overload)</strong></dt>
        <dd>I use Sunday evenings to plan meals, prep my daughter‚Äôs clothes, and organize my class work. This avoids chaos when school starts <em>(4 A‚Äôs of stress management, Week 7 PDF, Slide 11)</em>.</dd>

        <dt><strong>Use Positive Self-Talk</strong></dt>
        <dd>When I start thinking "I‚Äôm a failure,‚Äù I pause and say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing my best and my best is powerful" <em>(Week 7 PDF, Slide 25)</em>.</dd>

        <dt><strong>Adjust Expectations: Progress, Not Perfection</strong></dt>
        <dd>I used to think I had to get everything perfect: grades, parenting, work. Now, I just try to show up. I focus on improvement over perfection <em>(Slide 13)</em>.</dd>

        <dt><strong>Ask for Help, Even Small Help Counts</strong></dt>
        <dd>I used to suffer silently. Now, even asking a friend to babysit for 2 hours so I can sleep is a game-changer. Talk to supportive family and friends <em>(Slide 14)</em>.</dd>

        <dt><strong>Use Short Breaks for Grounding</strong></dt>
        <dd>I now take short breaks, even just 2 minutes, to breathe, listen to calm music, or sip tea when I‚Äôm overwhelmed. It stops the stress from building too high. This connects to the ‚ÄúStop, See It Differently‚Äù tool <em>(Slide 26)</em>.</dd>

      <h3>üßòüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Three Stress Management Techniques</h3>

            <li>Close your eyes and imagine a calming setting like the beach or a peaceful forest</li>
            <li>Focus on details: What do you hear? Smell? Feel?</li>
            <li>Breathe slowly and stay in that space for 5 to 10 minutes</li>
          </ul>
          Used to reduce tension and restore calm <em>(Slide 30)</em>.
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>Progressive Muscle Relaxation</strong></dt>

            <li>Focus on the difference between tension and release</li>
          </ul>
          Effective for stress and body awareness <em>(Slide 32)</em>.
