      <h2>What is Stress & How It Affects Me</h2>

      <h3>What is Stress?</h3>
      <p>Stress is the emotional, physical, and mental strain you feel when life becomes too much to handle. 
        It raises your heart rate, puts you in survival mode, and shows up when you're overwhelmed by responsibilities, pressure, or hard decisions. It’s not just in your mind. 
        It’s something you feel in your body, especially when you're stretched thin trying to manage school, parenting, finances, and your own well-being.</p>
      <h3>🧠 When I Feel Most Stressed</h3>
      <p>My stress hits hardest at the start of the week. I have to leave my daughter two hours away, three to four days a week just to attend school. 
        Watching her cry and refuse to go is heartbreaking and that separation affects me deeply. The guilt follows me into every class and assignment.</p>

      <h3>🩺 How Stress Affects My Body</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Loss of appetite:</strong> 100% — I can go a whole day without eating</li>
        <li><strong>Fatigue:</strong> 80% — I often feel drained even after resting</li>
        <li><strong>Chest pain:</strong> 50% — especially during emotional or financial pressure</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>💔 How It Affects My Mind and Emotions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Anxiety</li>
        <li>Frustration</li>
        <li>Guilt</li>
        <li>Sadness</li>
        <li>Anger</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There was a time I became completely shut down — I stopped going out, bit my nails constantly, couldn’t take my daughter to the park. After losing my mom, everything felt like danger. I was in full emotional shutdown.</p>

      <h3>💪 How I Learned to Push Through</h3>
      <p>At first, stress used to stop me. But I got tired of failing. I started listening to motivational videos, reading books, meditating, and reshaping how I think. I went from surviving to succeeding. I joined the C-Women in IT program and now,
         I'm finishing my first semester in Software Engineering & AI at Centennial College with four A's. If that’s not pushing through, I don’t know what is.</p>

      <h3>☁️ Coping Methods — The Healthy & The Hard</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Smoking weed to concentrate</li>
        <li>Crying in silence</li>
        <li>Skipping meals</li>
        <li>Overworking</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It’s not ideal, but when you don’t have support, you do what you can just to stay standing.</p>

      <h3>🫢 Why I Don’t Always Speak Up</h3>
      <p>Most people think I get a lot of support because I’m focused and successful with the tasks I have. 
        They don’t know the truth unless I say it and even then, I feel like I’m defending myself. That’s why I don’t often talk about it. But the silence is heavy.</p>
