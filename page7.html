      <h2>Page 7: What Society Can Do</h2>

      <p>People often assume that single mothers, especially newcomers, must be used to hardship or must be getting help. But the truth is, we are overlooked, overworked, and undersupported. When we struggle, our children struggle too. Real change doesn’t begin with charity; it begins with understanding, action, and systemlevel support.</p>

      <dl>
        <dt><strong>🧠 Normalize Support Without Judgment</strong></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Too often, single moms feel ashamed to ask for help. We’re told, "You chose this," or "Just be strong." We need a culture where receiving help is a sign of wisdom, not weakness.</p>
          <p><strong>What can be done:</strong> Launch awareness campaigns that highlight the realities of single motherhood, especially for newcomers, so people understand what this life really looks like.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>🏫 Expand OnCampus Childcare and Flexible Classes</strong></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Many of us are students trying to improve our futures, but lectures and labs often clash with childcare responsibilities.</p>
          <p><strong>What can be done:</strong> Colleges and universities should offer evening or weekend childcare and more flexible online classes for studentparents.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>🏨 Create Safe and Affordable Housing for Mothers</strong></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Housing is one of the biggest stressors. If I can't afford rent, I can't focus in school. I can’t sleep. I can’t heal.</p>
          <p><strong>What can be done:</strong> Government and local programs should expand rent subsidies, priority housing, and transitional shelters specifically for women fleeing domestic abuse or parenting alone.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>❤️ Invest in Mental Health and Culturally Aware Therapy</strong></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Many single mothers carry trauma from their home country or partners, but affordable therapy that understands our cultural backgrounds is hard to find.</p>
          <p><strong>What can be done:</strong> Increase funding for free or lowcost mental health services designed for immigrants, women of color, and mothers.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>💼 Support Flexible Work Opportunities</strong></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>When you’re a single parent, most jobs are not made for you. School dropoffs, sick kids, long commutes  it doesn’t fit.</p>
          <p><strong>What can be done:</strong> Push for flexible job options and childinclusive workplace policies so mothers can earn without sacrificing their children’s care.</p>
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <h3>Final Words</h3>
      <p>We don’t need pity. We need policies.<br>
         We don’t need empty praise. We need practical help.<br>
         Support us, and you support our children, our future, and the entire society we’re raising them in.</p>
