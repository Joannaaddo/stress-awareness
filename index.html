      <h2>My Journey as an International Single Mother</h2>
      <p>My name is <strong>Joan Addo</strong>, and I am a proud international single mother and Software Engineering student. I came to Canada from Nigeria to escape abuse, hoping to give my daughter a better life. Just three months after arriving, I lost my mother, my only support system and since then, I’ve had to stand on my own.</p>

      <p>In the beginning, I had no help from anyone. I carried my daughter on my back to braid hair, clean houses, and do whatever I could to survive. Some nights we would finish working at 12 a.m., both of us exhausted. It broke my heart knowing she didn’t have everything she deserved, but I had to feed her.</p>

      <p>Eventually, I began receiving support through the child tax benefit, and it made a difference. But the weight I carry hasn’t changed. I am the only parent, the only worker, the only comforter and the only one making sacrifices every day.</p>

      <p>Because I’m strong and I keep moving forward, people often assume that being a single mother in a foreign country is easy. They don’t see the tears, the mental exhaustion, the guilt, or the fear. They just see progress not the price paid for it.</p>

      <p>I created this website to speak the truth — not just for me, but for every international single mother trying to hold it all together. I want to help others manage their stress, take care of their mental and physical health, and feel seen.</p>
