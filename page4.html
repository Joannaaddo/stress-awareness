      <h2>üíî Page 4: Health Consequences of Chronic Stress</h2>

      <p>Being a single mother and an international student comes with constant pressure, and that pressure has real, damaging effects on both the body and mind. Stress is not just emotional; it breaks you down physically. Over time, I started seeing signs that my body and mind were overwhelmed. I now understand how dangerous untreated stress can become.</p>

          <p><strong>Fatigue and Sleep Disturbances</strong><br>
          When I am overworked, worried about bills, or juggling assignments late into the night, sleep becomes impossible. Even when I do rest, I wake up exhausted. My feet feel heavy and painful from standing too long due to the stress and anxiety of needing to keep going.<br>
          Chronic stress is a leading cause of insomnia, fatigue, and low energy, especially in single parents who lack downtime or recovery periods <em>(CMHA, 2024)</em>.</p>

          <p><strong>Body Pain and High Blood Pressure</strong><br>
          I developed severe back pain that lasted two to three months. I could not bend without shouting in pain. Stress lives in the body. I watched stress destroy my mother. She was a single mother too. She overworked herself so hard that she developed chronic leg issues. With no proper rest and constant pain, she took painkillers regularly. Eventually, that led to liver disease, and she passed away. This history weighs heavily on me.<br>
          Research shows that financial stress and emotional overload can lead to chronic pain, high blood pressure, and heart issues, especially in women <em>(Stamos, 2021; Time, 2024)</em>.</p>

          <p><strong>Anxiety Disorders</strong><br>
          The fear of the unknown haunts me daily:<br>
          Will I have enough to eat this week?<br>
          Will my assignment be late because of child care?<br>
          What if I cannot pay rent next month?<br>
          Studies show that single mothers are twice as likely to develop anxiety symptoms compared to partnered mothers <em>(Liang et al., 2019)</em>. Anxiety becomes a constant background noise in your mind; it never shuts off.</p>

          <p><strong>Depression</strong><br>
          In 2023, I was in a dark place. I had just lost my mother shortly after arriving in Canada. I was trying to care for my child while settling in a new country, facing school, survival jobs, and grief all at once. I barely ate. I could not laugh. I withdrew from friends.<br>
          But I still woke up every day, made breakfast, and held my daughter. That is what motherhood does; it forces you to function through the pain.<br>
          According to the Brookings Institute <em>(2024)</em>, nearly one in three single mothers experience moderate to severe depressive symptoms, especially those without financial or emotional support.</p>
