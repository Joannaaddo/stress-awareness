      <h2>My Five Biggest Stressors as an International Single Mother</h2>

      <p>The stress I face as a single mother isn't just about raising a child, it's about doing it all alone in a foreign country. As an international student, I have no family here. I left home to escape abuse, and just months after arriving, I lost my mother, my only support system. Now I juggle survival jobs, school, parenting, legal paperwork, and life with no help. These stressors are unique to women like me because we’re not just building a life, we’re rebuilding one from scratch.</p>

      <dl>
        <dt><strong>1️⃣ Financial Pressure</strong></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Single mothers often face long term financial hardship and limited resources, which can lead to serious mental and emotional strain <em>(CJCJ, 2017, p. 72)</em>.</p>
          <p>My mother suffered under this kind of pressure. She worked endlessly to give us a better life, but the stress was never addressed. She developed a leg issue that led to chronic medication use, which damaged her liver. She passed away from it.</p>
          <p>Now I carry that same burden. In Canada, I do multiple jobs braiding hair, cleaning, and cooking just to provide the basics for my daughter. Sometimes I skip my own meals or go without so she doesn’t have to.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>2️⃣ Separation from My Child</strong></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Single mothers report high stress due to the sole responsibility of parenting, especially without emotional or practical support <em>(CJCJ, 2017, p. 71)</em>.</p>
          <p>I remember dropping her off at a friend’s house for childcare, watching her cry and beg me not to leave. I had no choice, I had to attend school or work because I am the only provider and caregiver. That kind of emotional pain lingers long after the door closes.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>3️⃣ Lack of Support & Isolation</strong></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Single motherhood is isolating. When you’re caring for a child full time and trying to survive, there's no room left for a social life. I often drown myself in my schoolwork when my daughter is away just to avoid feeling the emptiness.</p>
          <p>According to <em>The Guardian</em> (2024), loneliness is even more common among new mothers, especially those who are young, immigrants, without supportive partners, or raising kids with health challenges. I live that reality daily. When she’s not with me, I feel lost in a world that moves without me.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>4️⃣ Behavioral Struggles in Children</strong></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Many single moms experience more parenting stress when their children show emotional or behavioral issues, especially when they can’t afford therapy or daycare <em>(CJCJ, 2017, p. 74)</em>.</p>
          <p>Growing up, my brother’s behavior was a major stressor for my mother. Without a male figure, it was hard for her to guide him. Now, I see the same pattern my daughter absorbs my stress. When I’m overwhelmed or distant, she becomes anxious or withdrawn.</p>
          <p>Studies confirm this: children’s behavior problems can increase a mother’s stress, which then worsens the child’s behavior, a cycle that’s hard to break <em>(Jiang et al., 2022)</em>.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>5️⃣ Mental Health Strain (Anxiety & Depression)</strong></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>The connection between parenting stress and depression is well established, especially in low income mothers without strong support systems <em>(CJCJ, 2017, p. 76)</em>.</p>
          <p>Research shows that single mothers are twice as likely to experience anxiety and depression compared to partnered moms <em>(Liang et al., 2019)</em>.</p>
          <p>In 2023, I hit a wall. I was chronically depressed. But I still had to be a mother. Still had to be a provider. The fear of the future eats away at me, especially when I don’t know how I’ll manage school, parenting, and life with so much uncertainty.</p>
